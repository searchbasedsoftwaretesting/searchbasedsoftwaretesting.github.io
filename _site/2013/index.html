<h2>Program Schedule &mdash; Friday, 22 March</h2>

<h3>09:00-10:30 Keynote and Discussion Session &mdash; Distinctive Themes and Opportunities in Search-Based Software Testing</h3>

<p>In this session we will explore current themes that distinguish SBST from other testing techniques, and discuss future opportunities for SBST.  To provide a structure for this discussion, we have invited three short position keynotes:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Myra Cohen</li>
	<li>Phil McMinn - "Searching for Readable, Realistic Test Cases"</li>
	<li>Simon Poulding - "What Does Valuable SBST Research Look Like?"</li>
</ul>

<h3>10:30-11:00 Coffee</h3>

<h3>11:00-12:30 Tool Competition Session</h3>

<ul>
<li>Tanja Vos - "Introduction to the SBST2013 tool competition"</li>
<li>Gordon Fraser and Andrea Arcuri - "EvoSuite at the SBST 2013 Tool Competition"</li>
<li>I.S.W.B. Prasetya - "Measuring T2 against SBST 2013 Benchmark Suite"</li>
<li>Sebastian Bauersfeld (on behalf of Mainul Islam and Christoph Csallner) - "Unit Testing Tool competition: Results for Dsc"</li>
</ul>

<h3>12:30-14:00 Lunch</h3>

<h3>14:00-15:30 Technical Paper Session</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kiran Lakhotia - "En Garde: Winning Coding Duels Through Genetic Programming"</li>
<li>Kivanc Doganay, Markus Bohlin, and Ola Sellin - "Search Based Testing of Embedded Systems Implemented in IEC 61131-3: An Industrial Case Study"</li>
</ul>

<h2>About the Workshop</h2>

<p>Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) applies metaheuristic search techniques&mdash;such as hill climbing, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms&mdash;to automate aspects of the software testing process.  The International Workshop on Search-Based Software Testing has been held in conjunction with ICST every year since 2008 as a forum for SBST researchers and industrial practitioners to share experience. During that time the field has expanded and matured: many SBST techniques are now considered mainstream testing approaches. In recognition of this progress, the format of the 2013 workshop has been enhanced to include an assessment of the current capabilities of SBST and to encourage a discussion of future directions.</p>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit full papers (maximum of 10 pages) to the workshop on original research&mdash;either empirical or theoretical&mdash;in SBST, practical experience of using SBST, or SBST tools.</p>
  
<p>We will also welcome short papers (maximum of 4 pages) on any one of the following topics:
<ul>
    <li>extended abstracts on novel techniques, ideas and positions that have yet to be fully developed;</li>
    <li>a discussion of the importance of a recently published (on or after 1 January 2012) SBST result by another author in setting a direction for the SBST community and/or the potential applicability (or not) of the result in an industrial context; or,</li>	
	<li>an entry to the tool competition described below.</li>
</ul>

<p>New this year, we invite developers of tools for Java unit testing at the class level&mdash;both SBST and non-SBST&mdash;to participate in a tools competition! Competition entries are in the form of short papers (maximum of 4 pages) describing an evaluation of your tool against a benchmark supplied by the workshop organisers. See the <a href="http://sbstcontest.dsic.upv.es">competition website</a> for further details. The results of the tools competition will be presented at the workshop. We additionally plan to co-ordinate a journal paper jointly authored by the tool developers that evaluates the results of the competition.</p>

<p>In all cases, papers should address a problem in the software testing/verification/validation domain such as (but not limited to) generating testing data, prioritizing test cases, minimizing test suites, verifying software models, testing service-orientated architectures, constructing test suits for interaction testing, and validating real-time properties. The solution should apply a metaheuristic search strategy such as (but not limited to) random search, local search (e.g. hill climbing, simulated annealing, and tabu search), evolutionary algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and genetic programming), ant colony optimization, and particle swarm optimization.</p>

<p>Accepted papers will be published in IEEE Digital Library in the form of post-proceedings.</p>

<h2>Paper Submission</h2>
	
<p>All papers must conform to <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE conference format</a>.</p>  Long Papers must be a maximum of 10 pages; Short Papers (extended abstracts, discussions of a recent result, and tool competition entries) must be a maximum of 4 pages.

<p>Please submit papers in PDF format via the <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sbst2013
