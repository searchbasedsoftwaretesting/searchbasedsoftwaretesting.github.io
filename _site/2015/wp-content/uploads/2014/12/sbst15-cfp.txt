CALL FOR PAPERS
8TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SEARCH-BASED SOFTWARE TESTING (SBST 2015)

CO-LOCATED WITH ICSE 2015, FIRENZE, ITALY

http://www.searchbasedsoftwaretesting.org

About the Workshop
------------------
Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) is the application of optimizing
search techniques (for example, Genetic Algorithms) to solve problems
in software testing. SBST is used to generate test data, prioritize
test cases, minimize test suites, optimize software test oracles,
reduce human oracle cost, verify software models, test service-orientated 
architectures, construct test suites for interaction testing, 
and validate real-time properties.

The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and
industrial practitioners both from SBST and the wider software
engineering community to collaborate, to share experience and provide 
directions for future research, and to encourage the use of search techniques in
novel aspects of software testing in combination with other aspects
of the software engineering lifecycle.

Call for Papers
---------------
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit:

* Full papers (maximum of 7 pages) to the workshop on original
  research -- either empirical or theoretical -- in SBST, practical
  experience of using SBST, or SBST tools.

* Short papers (maximum of 4 pages) that describe novel techniques,
  ideas and positions that have yet to be fully developed; or are a
  discussion of the importance of a recently published SBST result by
  another author in setting a direction for the SBST community,
  and/or the potential applicability (or not) of the result in an
  industrial context.

* Position papers (maximum of 2 pages) that put analyze trends in SBST 
  and raise issues of importance. Position papers are intended to seed
  discussion and debate at the workshop, and will be reviewed with 
  respect to relevance and their ability to spark discussions. 

* Tool Competition entries (maximum of 4 pages). We invite researchers,
  students, and tool developers to design innovative new approaches to 
  software test generation. More information will be available soon on
  the SBST website.

In all cases, papers should address a problem in the software
testing/verification/validation domain or combine elements of those
domains with other concerns in the software engineering lifecycle.
Examples of problems in the software testing/verification/validation
domain include (but are not limited to) generating testing data,
prioritizing test cases, constructing test oracles, minimizing 
test suites, verifying software models, testing service-orientated 
architectures, constructing test suites for interaction testing, 
and validating real-time properties.

The solution should apply a metaheuristic search strategy such as (but
not limited to) random search, local search (e.g. hill climbing,
simulated annealing, and tabu search), evolutionary algorithms (e.g.
genetic algorithms, evolution strategies, and genetic programming),
ant colony optimization, and particle swarm optimization.
