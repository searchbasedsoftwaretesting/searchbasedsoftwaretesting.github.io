  abstract  = "The frequent non-availability of an automated oracle means that, in practice, 
               checking software behaviour is frequently a painstakingly manual task. Despite 
               the high cost of human oracle involvement, there has been little research 
               investigating how to make the role easier and less time- consuming. One source 
               of human oracle cost is the inherent unreadability of machine-generated test 
               inputs. In particular, automatically generated string inputs tend to be arbitrary 
               sequences of characters that are awkward to read. This makes test cases hard to
               comprehend and time-consuming to check. In this paper we present an approach in 
               which a natural language model is incorporated into a search-based input data 
               generation process with the aim of improving the human readability of generated 
               strings. We further present a human study of test inputs generated using the 
               technique on 17 open source Java case studies. For 10 of the case studies, the 
               participants recorded significantly faster times when evaluating inputs produced 
               using the language model, with medium to large effect sizes 60% of the time. In 
               addition, the study found that accuracy of test input evaluation was also 
               significantly improved for 3 of the case studies."

               efficiency of search-based testing when trying to generate branch adequate 
               test data. The algorithm combines symbolic information with dynamic analysis 
               and has two key advantages: It does not require any change in the underlying 
               test data generation technique and it avoids many problems traditionally associated 
               with symbolic execution, in particular the presence of loops. We have evaluated 
               the algorithm on industrial closed source and open source systems using both local 
               and global search-based testing techniques, demonstrating that both are 
               statistically significantly more efficient using our approach. The test for significance 
               was done using a one-sided, paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. On average, the 
               local search requires 23.41% and the global search 7.78% fewer fitness evaluations 
               when using a symbolic execution based fitness function generated by the algorithm."

  abstract  = "Due to the frequent non-existence of an automated oracle, test cases are often 
               evaluated manually in practice. However, this fact is rarely taken into account 
               by automatic test data generators, which seek to maximise a program's structural 
               coverage only. The test data produced tends to be of a poor fit with the program's 
               operational profile. As a result, each test case takes longer for a human to check, 
               because the scenarios that arbitrary-looking data represent require time and effort 
               to understand. This short paper proposes methods to extracting knowledge from 
               programmers, source code and documentation and its incorporation into the automatic 
               test data generation process so as to inject the realism required to produce test 
               cases that are quick and easy for a human to comprehend and check. The aim is to 
               reduce the so-called qualitative human oracle costs associated with automatic test 
               data generation. The potential benefits of such an approach are demonstrated with 
               a simple case study."

  abstract  = "Search-Based Software Testing is the use of a
               meta-heuristic optimizing search technique, such as a Genetic
               Algorithm, to automate or partially automate a testing task;
               for example the automatic generation of test data. Key to the
               optimization process is a problem-specific fitness function. The
               role of the fitness function is to guide the search to good
               solutions from a potentially infinite search space, within a
               practical time limit.
               Work on Search-Based Software Testing dates back to 1976,
               with interest in the area beginning to gather pace in the 1990s.
               More recently there has been an explosion of the amount of
               work. This paper reviews past work and the current state of
               the art, and discusses potential future research areas and open
               problems that remain in the field."

  abstract = "Search-Based Test Data Generation reformulates testing goals as fitness 
              functions so that test input generation can be automated by some chosen 
              search-based optimization algorithm. The optimization algorithm searches 
              the space of potential inputs, seeking those that are ``fit for purpose'', 
              guided by the fitness function. The search space of potential inputs can be 
              very large, even for very small systems under test. Its size is, of course, 
              a key determining factor affecting the performance of any search-based 
              approach. However, despite the large volume of work on Search-Based Software 
              Testing, the literature contains little that concerns the performance impact of 
              search space reduction. This paper proposes a static dependence analysis derived 
              from program slicing that can be used to support search space reduction. The paper 
              presents both a theoretical and empirical analysis of the application of this 
              approach to open source and industrial production code. The results provide 
              evidence to support the claim that input domain reduction has a significant 
              effect on the performance of local, global, and hybrid search, while a purely 
              random search is unaffected."

  abstract  = "Evolutionary testing is an approach to automating test data generation that 
               uses an evolutionary algorithm to search a test object's input domain for test 
               data. Nested predicates can cause problems for evolutionary testing, because 
               information needed for guiding the search only becomes available as each nested 
               conditional is satisfied. This means that the search process can overfit to early 
               information, making it harder, and sometimes near impossible, to satisfy constraints 
               that only become apparent later in the search. The article presents a testability 
               transformation that allows the evaluation of all nested conditionals at once. Two 
               empirical studies are presented. The first study shows that the form of nesting handled 
               is prevalent in practice. The second study shows how the approach improves evolutionary 
               test data generation."
