<h3> Empirical Evaluation of Search-Based Test-Case Generation: A
Systematic Review and Guidelines</h3>
<p>
Metaheuristic search techniques have been extensively used to automate
the process of generating test cases and thus providing solutions for
a more cost-effective testing process.  Since Search-based Software
Testing (SBST) techniques are heuristic by nature, they must be
empirically investigated in terms of how costly and effective they are
at reaching their test objectives and to assess whether they scale up
to realistic development artifacts. Such empirical studies are however
not trivial to design, perform, and report.
This presentation reports on the results of a systematic,
comprehensive review that aims at characterizing how empirical studies
have been designed and reported to investigate SBST
cost-effectiveness. Based on the results of this study, I will also
outline and illustrate a set of guidelines to make the empirical
assessment of SBST more systematic, by promoting well designed and
executed empirical studies.

<h3> Presenter's Bio</h3>
<p>



<b>Lionel C. Briand </b>is a group leader at the Simula Research laboratory
and a professor at the University of Oslo (Norway), leading projects
on software verification and validation in collaboration with
industry. Before that, he was on the faculty of the department of
Systems and Computer Engineering, Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada,
where he was full professor and held the Canada Research Chair (Tier
I) in Software Quality Engineering. He has also been the software
quality engineering department head at the Fraunhofer Institute for
Experimental Software Engineering, Germany, and worked as a research
scientist for the Software Engineering Laboratory, a consortium of the
NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, CSC, and the University of Maryland,
USA.


Lionel has been on the program, steering, or organization committees
of many international, IEEE and ACM conferences. He is the
coeditor-in-chief of Empirical Software Engineering (Springer) and is
a member of the editorial boards of Systems and Software Modeling
(Springer) and Software Testing, Verification, and Reliability
(Wiley). He was on the board of IEEE Transactions on Software
Engineering from 2000 to 2004.
Lionel is an IEEE Fellow and a registered Canadian engineer (Ontario).
His research interests include: model-driven development, testing and
quality assurance, and empirical software engineering.
