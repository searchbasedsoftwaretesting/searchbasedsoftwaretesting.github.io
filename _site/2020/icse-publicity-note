The Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) Workshop is one of the longest-standing workshops co-located with ICSE. SBST is the application of optimizing search techniques to solve problems in software testing. SBST is used to generate test data, prioritize test cases, minimize test suites, optimize software test oracles, reduce human oracle cost, verify software models, test service-orientated architectures, construct test suites for interaction testing, and validate real time properties (among others).  In all cases, papers should address a problem in the software testing/verification/validation domain or combine elements of those domains with other concerns in the software engineering lifecycle.  We are also pleased to announce our 8th edition of the Java unit testing tools competition.  Please see our website (https://sbst20.github.io/) for more details.  We invite you to submit full papers (8 pages), short papers (4 pages), position papers (2 pages), and tool competition reports (4 pages). Submission deadlines: January 22nd (research papers) and February 3rd (tools competition reports).
