<h2>Welcome</h2>

<p>The 5th International Workshop on Search-Based Software Testing, will be held on the 21st of April 2012, in conjunction with the <a href="http://icst2012.soccerlab.polymtl.ca/Content/home/index.php?language=english">5th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST 2012)</a>. The workshop will provide:</p>

<ul>
    <li> a platform for interaction between search-based researchers and researchers from other areas of the software testing community with the aim of strengthening and developing search-based testing research</li>

    <li> a dedicated workshop for the search-based software testing community</li>
    <li> an open forum for the discussion of new ideas and future directions</li>
    <li> a format giving detailed feedback to researchers in search-based software testing on their latest results</li>

</ul>

<h2>Call for Papers</h2>

<p>Search-based software testing is the use of random or directed search
techniques (hill climbing, genetic algorithms etc.) to address 
problems in the software testing and verification and validation
domain. There has been an explosion of activity in the search-based
software testing field of late, particularly on test data generation.
Recent work has also focused on other aspects such as model-based
testing, real-time testing, interaction testing, testing of 
service-oriented architectures, test case prioritization and 
generation of whole tests (not only test data).</p>  

<p>Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit full papers 
(10 pages) to the workshop, describing <strong>original research, experience or tools</strong>. 
We will also welcome extended abstracts (4 pages) with new results (that may not yet have empirical support), position papers or far-out ideas. Extended abstracts can also be written to describe testing problems for which we can find search-based solutions during the workshop. We will have a poster session where authors of extended abstracts get feedback, but we will also discuss relevant extended abstracts in the main session.</p>

<p>Papers should address a problem in the software testing and/or 
verification and validation domain and should approach the solution 
to the problem using a search strategy. Search-based techniques are 
taken to include (but are not limited to) random search, local search
(e.g. hill climbing, simulated annealing and tabu search), evolutionary 
algorithms (e.g. genetic algorithms, evolution strategies and genetic programming), ant colony optimization and particle swarm optimization.</p>

<p>While experimental results are important for research papers, 
contributions that do not contain results, but rather present new 
approaches, concepts and/or theory will also be considered. The 
workshop will have a highly interactive format that encourages 
discussion about the presented papers and about general themes in
search-based software testing.</p>

<p><strong>Papers will be published as a proceedings in the IEEE digital library</strong>,
along with the rest of the proceedings for ICST 2012.</p>
