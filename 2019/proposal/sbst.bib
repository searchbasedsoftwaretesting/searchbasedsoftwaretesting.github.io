                  Based Software Engineering (SBSE) testing
                  system. Sapienz has been deployed in production at
                  Facebook since September 2017 to design test cases,
                  localise and triage crashes to developers and to
                  monitor their fixes. Since then, running in fully
                  continuous integration within Facebook's production
                  development process, Sapienz has been testing
                  Facebook's Android app, which consists of millions
                  of lines of code and is used daily by hundreds of
                  millions of people around the globe.",
