% November 19th  2011 - MH



%% Updated Feb 22nd 2006 by Jen Krinke:-
%% Jens did a pass to correct a mistake that had been in slice.bib since 1994.
%% Jens explains below:-
%% All address fields have to be checked.  `address' should contain
%% the publisher's address. However, many addresses below are the
%% conference locations, which are usually stored in the `location'
%% field.  Many addresses have been corrected, but a large amount is
%% still not correct
%%
%% Note: 
%% For some journals, the `location' field has to be renamed to `city' 


% This slice.bib grew out of the project project publicly available
% slice.bib file.
%
% However, it now contains commentary on some papers, supplied by members of
% the group and others (where obtainable). Many of these comments are intended
% for internal consumption only and therefore the file is
%
%                             NOT FOR PUBLIC DISSEMINATION

		 avoided by finding more faults earlier in a software
		 testing process. Therefore, determination of which
		 software testing phases to focus improvements work on,
		 has considerable industrial interest. This paper
		 evaluates the use of five different techniques, namely
		 particle swarm optimization based artificial neural
		 networks (PSO-ANN), artificial immune recognition
		 systems (AIRS), gene expression programming (GEP),
		 genetic programming (GP) and multiple regression (MR),
		 for predicting the number of faults slipping through
		 unit, function, integration and system testing phases.
		 The objective is to quantify improvement potential in
		 different testing phases by striving towards finding
		 the right faults in the right phase. We have conducted
		 an empirical study of two large projects from a
		 telecommunication company developing mobile platforms
		 and wireless semiconductors. The results are compared
		 using simple residuals, goodness of fit and absolute
		 relative error measures. They indicate that the four
		 search-based techniques (PSO-ANN, AIRS, GEP, GP)
		 perform better than multiple regression for predicting
		 the fault-slip-through for each of the four testing
		 phases. At the unit and function testing phases, AIRS
		 and PSO-ANN performed better while GP performed better
		 at integration and system testing phases. The study
		 concludes that a variety of search-based techniques are
		 applicable for predicting the improvement potential in
		 different testing phases with GP showing more
		 consistent performance across two of the four test
		 phases."

                 for impact analysis and the propagation of change. This
                 paper presents a knowledge-based model for both. This
                 model is generic because it is not based on any
                 language or design method. Therefore, it can be applied
                 on the basis of a `problem' to be solved. It also
                 captures four life-cycle phases: requirement,
                 specification, design and programming. We also provide
                 a domain-specific view that allows the dependency
                 analysis of fine-grain objects. Two kinds of
                 dependencies are identified: inter-phase dependencies,
                 these are dependency relations between the objects of
                 one phase and another; and intra-phase dependencies,
                 these are dependency relations between the objects of
                 the same phase. In order to validate this model, we
                 also present a prototype based on two life-cycle
                 phases: design and programming."

                 These additions encourage declarative programming and

                 involve search. We illustrate the use of Alma-O by
                 presenting solutions to a number of classical problems,
                 including [alpha]-[beta] search, STRIPS planning,
                 knapsack, and Eight Queens. These solutions are
                 substantially simpler than their counterparts written
                 in the imperative or in the logic programming style and
                 can be used for different purposes without any
                 modification. We also discuss here the implementation

Since the 1970s the goal of generating programs in an automatic way
(i.e., Automatic Programming) has been sought. A user would just
define what he expects from the program (i.e., the requirements), and
it should be automatically generated by the computer without the help
of any programmer. Unfortunately, this task is much harder than
expected. Although transformation methods are usually employed to
address this problem, they cannot be employed if the gap between the
specification and the actual implementation is too wide. In this paper
we introduce a novel conceptual framework for evolving programs from
their specification. We use genetic programming to evolve the
programs, and at the same time we exploit the specification to
co-evolve sets of unit tests. Programs are rewarded by how many tests
they do not fail, whereas the unit tests are rewarded by how many
programs they make to fail. We present and analyse seven different
problems on which this novel technique is successfully applied."

	led the investigation to how to automate them. In particular, Software
	Testing can take up to half of the resources of the development of
	new software. Although there has been a lot of work on automating
	the testing phase, fixing a bug after its presence has been discovered
	is still a duty of the programmers. In this paper we propose an evolutionary
	approach to automate the task of fixing bugs. This novel evolutionary
	approach is based on Co-evolution, in which programs and test cases
	co-evolve, influencing each other with the aim of fixing the bugs
	of the programs. This competitive co-evolution is similar to what
	happens in nature for predators and prey. The user needs only to
	provide a buggy program and a formal specification of it. No other
	information is required.
	
	Hence, the approach may work for any implementable software. We show
	some preliminary experiments in which bugs in an implementation of
	a sorting algorithm are automatically fixed.},

Traces the causes of the Pentium bug; both technical and managerial.
A very interesting paper.
I used it as teh basis for my section on the Penium bug in my 1998
study guide for CS215 (Software Development). The talk was pretty good too,
I can still remember it almost three years later.

                 decomposable into a finite number of given base
                 diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
                 to a suitable extension of the given set and of the
                 basic mappings defined in it. Two normalization methods
                 of flow diagrams are given. The first has three base
                 diagrams; the second only two. In the second part of
                 the paper, the second methd is applied to the theory of
                 Turing machines. With every Turing machine provided
                 with a two-way half-tape, there is associated a similar
                 machine, doing essentially the same job, but working on
                 a tape obtained from the first one by interspersing
                 alternate blank squares. The new machine belongs to the
                 family, elsewhere introduced, generated by composition
                 and iteration from the two machines $\lambda$ and $R$.
                 That family is a proper subfamily of the whole family

                 set into itself. Although not every diagram is
                 decomposable into a finite number of given base
                 diagrams, this becomes true at a semantical level due
                 to a suitable extension of the given set and of the
                 basic mappings defined in it. Two normalization methods
                 of flow diagrams are given. The first has three base
                 diagrams; the second only two. In the second part of
                 the paper, the second methd is applied to the theory of
                 Turing machines. With every Turing machine provided
                 with a two-way half-tape, there is associated a similar
                 machine, doing essentially the same job, but working on
                 a tape obtained from the first one by interspersing
                 alternate blank squares. The new machine belongs to the
                 family, elsewhere introduced, generated by composition
                 and iteration from the two machines $\lambda$ and $R$.
                 That family is a proper subfamily of the whole family

		 measures are derived based on an experimental goal,
		 identifying fault-prone software parts, and several
		 experimental hypotheses arising from the development of
		 Ada systems for Flight Dynamics Software at the NASA
		 Goddard Space Flight Center (NASA/GSFC). Specifically,
		 we define a set of measures for cohesion and coupling,
		 which satisfy a previously published set of
		 mathematical properties that are necessary for any such
		 measure to be valid. We then investigate the measures'
		 relationship to fault-proneness on three large scale
		 projects, to provide empirical support for their
		 practical significance and usefulness.",

  abstract =     "Accurate software effort estimation is an important
                 part of the software process. Originally, estimation
                 was performed using only human expertise, but more
                 recently attention has turned to a variety of machine
                 learning methods. This paper attempts to evaluate
                 critically the potential of genetic programming (GP) in
                 software effort estimation when compared with
                 previously published approaches, in terms of accuracy
                 and ease of use. The comparison is based on the
                 well-known Desharnais data set of 81 software projects
                 derived from a Canadian software house in the late
                 1980s. The input variables are restricted to those
                 available from the specification stage and significant
                 effort is put into the GP and all of the other solution
                 strategies to offer a realistic and fair comparison.
                 There is evidence that GP can offer significant
                 improvements in accuracy but this depends on the
                 measure and interpretation of accuracy used. GP has the
                 potential to be a valid additional tool for software
                 effort estimation but set up and running effort is high
                 and interpretation difficult, as it is for any complex
                 meta-heuristic technique.",

                 set of the machine and the semantics of those
                 instructions by a combination of natural language and
                 ISP (Instruction Set Processor) descriptions. The
                 syntax of the instructions in assembly is well define
                 in the form of tables in the manual. However, the
                 semantics is not so well specified and descriptions
                 vary widely from one manual to another. When developing
                 a retargetable binary translator, as much as possible
                 needs to be specified in order to automatically
                 generate code from specifications, hence separating
                 machine-independent issues from the manual coding
                 stage. The specification of the semantics of machine
                 instructions is one such task, with the aim of
                 generating suitable code for an intermediate
                 representation that is to be used during the analysis
                 stage. We describe the design process used to develop a
                 semantic specification language, SSL, to integrate into
                 a retargetable binary translation framework. The
                 techniques described herein are suitable not just to
                 binary translators but also to machine-code
                 manipulation tools such as optimizing compilers, binary
                 profilers, instrumentors, and binary debuggers.",

                 the existing software so as to produce software
                 component sets, each of which is a candidate for
                 clustering and reengineering into a reusable module.
                 This step is founded on one ore more Candidature
                 Criteria and the cost of the following steps depend on
                 their quality. This paper introduces the notions of
                 completeness and adequacy as applied to candidature
                 criteria and outlines the need for an adquacy
                 validation process before they are applied on a

                 on the assignment of a concept to the candidate modules
                 is proposed and the results coming from an application
                 of this process are described and discussed.",

                 attempt is made to formulate techniques of program
                 modification, whereby a program that achieves one
                 result can be transformed into a new program that uses
                 the same principles to achieve a different goal. For
                 example, a program that uses the binary search paradigm
                 to divide two numbers may be modified to calculate the
                 square-root of a number in a similar manner. Program
                 debugging is considered as a special case of
                 modification; if a program computes wrong results, it
                 must be modified to achieve the intended results. The
                 application of abstract program schemata to concrete
                 problems is also viewed from the perspective of
                 modification techniques. We have embedded this approach
                 in a running implementation; our methods are
                 illustrated with several examples that have been

                 Unfortunately, legacy data structures tend to grow over
                 time, and may contain many unrelated fields at the time
                 of migration. We propose a method for identifying

                 of record fields of interest, the identification of
                 procedures actually dealing with such fields, and the
                 construction of coherent groups of fields and
                 procedures into candidate classes. We explore the use
                 of cluster and concept analysis for the purpose of
                 object identification, and we illustrate their effect
                 on a 100,000 LOC COBOL system. Furthermore, we use

                 estimation is a long-standing issue in the software
                 engineering field. The results of other works have
                 shown different patterns for the unknown function,
                 which relates software size to project cost (effort).
                 In this work, the research about this problem has been
                 made by using the technique of Genetic Programming (GP)
                 for exploring the possible cost functions. Both
                 standard regression analysis and GP have been applied
                 and compared on several data sets. However, regardless
                 of the method, the basic size-effort relationship does
                 not show satisfactory results, from the predictive
                 point of view, across all data sets. One of the results
                 of this work is that we have not found significant
                 deviations from the linear model in the software cost
                 functions. This result comes from the marginal cost
                 analysis of the equations with best predictive

                 interprocedural data flow analysis have led to an
                 increased interest in demand-driven algorithms. In this
                 article, we present a general framework for developing
                 demand-driven interprocedural data flow analyzers and
                 report our experience in evaluating the performance of
                 this approach. A demand for data flow information is
                 modeled as a set of queries. The framework includes a
                 generic demand-driven algorithm that determines the
                 response to query by iteratively applying a system of
                 query propagation rules. The propagation rules yield
                 precise responses for the class of distributive finite
                 data flow problems. We also describe a two-phase
                 framework variation to accurately handle
                 nondistributive problems. A performance evaluation of
                 our demand-driven approach is presented for two data
                 flow problems, namely, reaching-definitions and copy
                 constant propagation. Our experiments show that
                 demand-driven analysis performs well in practice,
                 reducing both time and space requirements when compared
                 with exhaustive analysis.",

  abstract =     "Understanding the implementation of a certain feature
                 of a system requires identification of the
                 computational units of the system that contribute to
                 this feature. In many cases, the mapping of features to
                 the source code is poorly documented. In this paper, we
                 present a semiautomatic technique that reconstructs the
                 mapping for features that are triggered by the user and
                 exhibit an observable behavior. The mapping is in
                 general not injective; that is, a computational unit
                 may contribute to several features. Our technique
                 allows for the distinction between general and specific
                 computational units with respect to a given set of
                 features. For a set of features, it also identifies
                 jointly and distinctly required computational units.
                 The presented technique combines dynamic and static
                 analyses to rapidly focus on the system's parts that
                 relate to a specific set of features. Dynamic
                 information is gathered based on a set of scenarios
                 invoking the features. Rather than assuming a
                 one-to-one correspondence between features and
                 scenarios as in earlier work, we can now handle
                 scenarios that invoke many features. Furthermore, we
                 show how our method allows incremental exploration of
                 features while preserving the {"}mental map{"} the
                 analyst has gained through the analysis."

                 these invariants are usually implicit. An alternative
                 to expecting programmers to fully annotate code with
                 invariants is to automatically infer likely invariants
                 from the program itself. This research focuses on
                 dynamic techniques for discovering invariants from
                 execution traces. \par This article reports three
                 results. First, it describes techniques for dynamically
                 discovering invariants, along with an implementation,
                 named Daikon, that embodies these techniques. Second,
                 it reports on the application of Daikon to two sets of
                 target programs. In programs from Gries's work on
                 program derivation, the system rediscovered predefined
                 invariants. In a C program lacking explicit invariants,
                 the system discovered invariants that assisted a
                 software evolution task. These experiments demonstrate
                 that, at least for small programs, invariant inference
                 is both accurate and useful. Third, it analyzes
                 scalability issues such as invariant detection runtime
                 and accuracy as functions of test suites and program
                 points instrumented."

                 crucial to the practicality of such an approach. This
                 paper describes research directed towards applying one
                 particular transformation method to problems of
                 increasing scale. The method adopted is that developed
                 by Burstall and Darlington, and familiarity with their
                 work is assumed. The problems which arise when
                 attempting transformation of larger scale programs are
                 discussed, and an approach to overcoming them is
                 presented. Parts of the approach have been embodied in
                 a machine-based system which assists a user in
                 transforming his programs. The approach, and the use of
                 this system, are illustrated by presenting portions of
                 the transformation of a compiler for a ``toy''
                 language."

  abstract =     "Software testing is very labor intensive and expensive
                 and accounts for a significant portion of software
                 system development cost. If the testing process could
                 be automated, the cost of developing software could be
                 significantly reduced. Test data generation in program
                 testing is the process of identifying a set of test
                 data that satisfies a selected testing criterion, such
                 as statement coverage and branch coverage. In this
                 article we present a {\em chaining approach\/} for
                 automated software test data generation which builds on
                 the current theory of execution-oriented test data
                 generation. In the chaining approach, test data are
                 derived based on the actual execution of the program
                 under test. For many programs, the execution of the
                 selected statement may require prior execution of some
                 other statements. The existing methods of test data
                 generation may not efficiently generate test data for
                 these types of programs because they only use control
                 flow information of a program during the search
                 process. The chaining approach uses data dependence
                 analysis to guide the search process, i.e., data
                 dependence analysis automatically identifies statements
                 that affect the execution of the selected statement.
                 The chaining approach uses these statements to form a
                 sequence of statements that is to be executed prior to
                 the execution of the selected statement. The
                 experiments have shown that the chaining approach may
                 significantly improve the chances of finding test data
                 as compared to the existing methods of automated test
                 data generation."

                         major
                         obstacles. The first is understanding the program to be
                         modified. The second is validating the change while
                         insuring that the unmodified parts have not been
                         accidentally impacted. Traditional methods used to
                         understand and modify a program overwhelm the
                         maintainer of
                         today's large systems. A possible solution is to modify
                         the
                         process under which maintenance is performed. The

                 to help develop correct real-time systems. The domain
                 we consider is that of multiprogrammed real-time
                 applications, in which periodic tasks control physical
                 systems via interacting with external sensors and
                 actuators. While a system is up and running, these
                 operations must be performed as specified---otherwise
                 the system may fail. Correctness depends not only on
                 each program individually, but also on the
                 time-multiplexed behavior of all of the programs
                 running together. Errors due to overloaded resources
                 are exposed very late in a development process, and
                 often at runtime. They are usually remedied by
                 human-intensive activities such as instrumentation,
                 measurement, code tuning and redesign. We describe a
                 static alternative to this process, which relies on
                 well-accepted technologies from optimizing compilers
                 and fixed-priority scheduling. Specifically, when a set
                 of tasks are found to be overloaded, a scheduling
                 analyzer determines candidate tasks to be transformed
                 via program slicing. The slicing engine decomposes each
                 of the selected tasks into two fragments: one that is
                 ``time critical'' and the other ``unobservable.'' The
                 unobservable part is then spliced to the end of the
                 time-critical code, with the external semantics being
                 maintained. The benefit is that the scheduler may
                 postpone the unobservable code beyond its original
                 deadline, which can enhance overall schedulability.
                 While the optimization is completely local, the
                 improvement is realized globally, for the entire task
                 set."

		 years as an important research area within automated
		 software test data generation. The general approach of
		 couching the satisfaction of test goals as numerical
		 optimisation problems has been applied to a variety of
		 problems such as satisfying structural coverage
		 criteria, specification falsification, exception
		 generation, breaking unit pre-conditions and software
		 hazard discovery. However, some test goals may be hard
		 to satisfy. For example, a program branch may be
		 difficult to reach via a search based technique,
		 because the domain of the data that causes it to be
		 taken is exceedingly small or the non-linearity of the
		 fitness landscape precludes the provision of effective
		 guidance to the search for test data. In this paper we
		 propose to stretch relevant conditions within a program
		 to make them easier to satisfy. We find test data that
		 satisfies the corresponding test goal of the stretched
		 program. We then seek to transform the stretched
		 program by stages back to the original, simultaneously
		 migrating the obtained test data to produce test data
		 that satisfies the goal for the original program. The
		 stretching device is remarkably simple and shows
		 significant promise for obtaining hard-to-find test
		 data and also gives efficiency improvements over
		 standard search based testing approaches."

                 testing requirements and to optimize the number of test
                 cases required to achieve test coverage. Using this
                 approach, we were able to accurately and efficiently
                 determine path feasibility for moderately-sized program
                 units of production code written in a subset of Ada. On
                 these problems, the computer solutions were obtained
                 much faster and with greater accuracy than manual
                 analysis. The paper describes how we formalize test
                 criteria as control flow graph path expressions; how
                 the criteria are mapped to logic formulas; and how we
                 control the complexity of the inference task. It
                 describes the limitations of the system and proposals
                 for its improvement as well as other applications of
                 the analysis."

Abstract = {A technique for static slicing of logic programs is presented. The
method applies techniques originally developed for attribute grammars
to automatically infer and analyze the data flow pattern of a subject
program.

When mapping the general data flow pattern into a specific proof tree,
a slice with respect to indicated arguments in the tree can be
extracted. The main application area of the method is algorithmic
debugging where the produced slice can substantially improve the
debugger's performance by excluding those parts of the proof tree that
have no effect on the computation of erroneous output values. Improved
variants of the basic technique are also presented.}

  ABSTRACT     = {Slicing analyses have been proposed for
                  different programming languages. Rather than
                  defining a new analysis from scratch for each
                  programming language, we would like to specify
                  such an analysis once for all, in a
                  language-independent way, and then specialise
                  it for different programming languages. In
                  order to achieve this goal, we propose a notion
                  of natural semantics format and a dynamic
                  slicing analysis format. The natural semantics
                  format formalises a class of natural semantics
                  and the analysis format is a generic,
                  language-independent, slicing analysis. The
                  correctness of the generic analysis is
                  established as a relation between the
                  derivation trees of the original program and
                  the slice. This generic analysis is then
                  instantiated to several programming languages
                  conforming the semantics format (an imperative
                  language, a logic programming language and a
                  functional language), yielding a dynamic
                  slicing analyser for each of these languages.}

                 edges, the algorithm has a worst-case time bound of 0(e

                 loops. Consequently a restriction to one-entry one-exit
                 control structures guarantees linearity. The algorithm

                 spaces and graphs by relaxing the time bound. Examples

                 precise but require a large amount of run time overhead
                 due to the tracing information that is collected during
                 the program's execution. We present a general approach
                 for improving the precision and quality of static
                 slices by incorporating dynamic information in static
                 slicing, enabling the computation of hybrid slices. The
                 technique exploits dynamic information that is readily
                 available during debugging, namely breakpoint
                 information and the dynamic call graph. The precision
                 of static slicing is improved in hybrid slicing by more
                 accurately estimating the potential paths taken by the
                 program. The breakpoints and call/return points, used
                 as reference points, divide the execution path into
                 intervals. By associating each statement in the slice
                 with an execution interval, hybrid slicing technique
                 also improves the quality of slicing information.",

                 with each point in a program a set of ``dataflow
                 facts'' that are guaranteed to hold whenever that point
                 is reached during program execution. By contrast, a
                 {\em demand} dataflow analysis algorithm determines
                 whether a single given dataflow fact holds at a single
                 given point. This paper presents a new demand algorithm
                 for interprocedural dataflow analysis. The new
                 algorithm has three important properties:
                 \begin{itemize} \item It provides precise (meet over
                 all interprocedurally valid paths) solutions to a large
                 class of problems. \item It has a polynomial worst-case
                 cost for both a single demand and a sequence of all
                 possible demands. \item The worst-case total cost of
                 the sequence of all possible demands is no worse than
                 the worst-case cost of a single run of the current best
                 exhaustive algorithm. \end{itemize}"

		 Although, neural networks have shown their strengths in

		 `black boxes' has prevented them to be accepted as a
		 common practice for cost estimation. In this paper, we
		 study the interpretation of cost estimation models
		 based on a Back-propagation three multilayer Perceptron
		 network. Our idea consists in the use of a method that
		 maps this neural network to a fuzzy rule-based system.
		 Consequently, if the obtained fuzzy rules are easily
		 interpreted, the neural network will also be easy to
		 interpret. Our experiment is made using the COCOMO'81

                 proposed a hierarchical approach in which programs are
                 formed from independently evolved code fragments, each
                 of which is responsible for handling a subset of the
                 test input cases. Although this approach offers
                 substantial performance advantages in comparison to
                 more conventional systems, the programs it evolves
                 exhibit some undesirable properties for certain problem
                 domains. We therefore propose the introduction of a
                 self adaptive mechanism that allows the system
                 dynamically to focus evolutionary effort on the program
                 components most in need. Experimentation reveals that

                 to different variables. The program dependence graph
                 (PDG) satisfies neither of these criteria. We present a
                 new form of dependence graph that satisfies both, while
                 retaining the advantages of the PDG: it is easy to
                 construct and allows program slicing to be implemented
                 as a simple graph traversal. We define 'chopping', a
                 generalization of slicing that can express most of its
                 variants, and show that, using our dependence graph, it
                 produces more accurate results than algorithms based
                 directly on the PDG.",

		 The problem arises when the target function includes
		 guards that reference some of the program state
		 variables whose values depend on previous function
		 calls. Thus, merely considering the target function to
		 derive test data is not sufficient. This paper
		 introduces a testability transformation approach based
		 on the analysis of control and data flow dependencies
		 to bypass the state variable problem. It achieves this
		 by eliminating state variables from guards and/ or
		 determining which functions to call in order to satisfy
		 guards with state variables. A number of experiments
		 demonstrate the value of the proposed approach.",

           program whose behavior is identical, for the same
           program input, to that of an original program with
           respect to a variable(s) of interest at some execution
           position. In the existing dynamic slicing tools,
           dynamic slices are represented in the textual form,
           i.e., a dynamic slice is displayed to programmers as a
           subprogram or as highlighted statements in the original
           program. Although dynamic slicing does narrow the size
           of the program, the textual representation of a dynamic
           slice does not provide much guidance in the
           understanding of program execution. During dynamic
           slice computation different types of information are
           computed and then discarded. In this paper we propose
           new dynamic-slicing related features that exploit this
           information for the purpose of understanding of program
           execution. These features were implemented in the
           dynamic slicing tool that is used to improve the
           process of program understanding.",

  abstract =     "Program slicing transforms a large program into a
                 smaller one that contains only statements relevant to
                 the computation of a given function. It has been shown
                 that program slicing can be useful in program
                 understanding. Traditionally, program slices are
                 represented in the textual form. Although slicing does
                 narrow the size of the program, the textual
                 representation of a slice does not provide much

                 this paper we present program slicing concepts on the
                 module level that allow for better understanding of
                 program slices of large programs and their executions.
                 These concepts have been developed for static and
                 dynamic program slicing and are combined with different
                 methods of visualization to guide programmers in the
                 process of program understanding. The presented
                 concepts have been implemented in the slicing tool that
                 is used to investigate the usefulness of these concepts

           ``black boxes'' because their source code is not
           available. In this paper we present an approach that
           can be used in black-box understanding of COTS
           components. The major objective is to reduce the effort
           required to reveal component properties by partially
           automating interface probing. A developer provides a
           full, or partial, description of a component property
           together with a search scope where assertions are used
           to describe component properties. Based on this
           information, a search engine automatically searches for
           component inputs on which the component property is
           revealed using a combination of existing automated test
           generation methods for black-box testing and for
           white-box testing. Our initial experience has shown
           that this approach may be a cost-effective way of
           revealing properties of components."

                 into the detection cycle. This paper describes a method
                 in which computer and human work together to find
                 atomic components. Furthermore, it discusses how the
                 techniques can be enhanced to work incrementally, which
                 is needed if they are to be integrated with this
                 method. Moreover, it proposes ways of combining the
                 techniques within this interactive method."

To quote on memory leaks:-


4039 The Inquiry Team has concluded that the system crash was caused by a
minor programming error. In carrying out some work on the system some three
weeks previously the SO programmer had inadvertently left in the system a
piece of program code that caused a small amount of memory within the file
server to be used up and not released every time a vehicle mobilisation was
generated by the system. Over a three week period these activities had
gradually used up all available memory thus causing the system to crash.
This programming error should not have occurred and was caused by
carelessness and lack of quality assurance of program code changes. Given
the nature of the fault it is unlikely that it would have been detected
through conventional programmer or user testing.

	The main research question is whether genetic programs can offer
	`better' solution search using public domain metrics rather than
	company specific ones. Unlike most previous research, a realistic
	approach is taken, whereby predictions are made on the basis of the
	data available at a given date. Experiments are reported, designed
	to assess the accuracy of estimates made using data within and beyond
	a specific company. This research also offers insights into genetic
	programming's performance, relative to alternative methods, as a
	problem solver in this domain. The results do not find a clear winner
	but, for this data, GP performs consistently well, but is harder
	to configure and produces more complex models. The evidence here
	agrees with other researchers that companies would do well to base
	estimates on in house data rather than incorporating public data
	sets. The complexity of the GP must be weighed against the small
	increases in accuracy to decide whether to use it as part of any
	effort prediction estimation.},

Discusses the therac 25 disaster.
One rather poorly trained software engineer wrote code to control
an x-ray therapy machine. It multitasked critical activity with other activity
and there were 6 cases of poverdoeses as a result.
Some of the patients died as a direct result of the software failure.
The incident(s) are briefly reported in my CS215 Software development notes and
study guide.

	to this kind of test data generation usually generate test data according
	to one mutant at one time. Thus, more test data that are needed for
	achieving a given mutation score. In this paper, we propose a new
	approach to generating one test data according to multiple mutants
	that are mutated at the same location at one time. Thus, our approach
	can generate smaller test suite that can achieve the same mutation
	testing score. To evaluate our approach, we implemented a prototype
	tool based on our approach and carried out some preliminary experiments.
	The experimental results show that our approach is more cost-effective.}

  abstract =     "It is generally recognized that one of the reasons
                 that software maintenance is so costly is that each
                 modification to a program must take into account the
                 numerous complex interrelationships in the existing
                 software; an understanding of program dependences is
                 fundamental to efficient software change. Such
                 dependences can be of the following types, data flow,
                 calling, and functional dependences. Furthermore, as
                 the software community gradually begins to move toward
                 a more object-oriented perspective on software
                 development, it will become increasingly important to
                 be able to 'objectify' existing software systems.
                 Successful maintenance requires precise knowledge of
                 the data items in a system, the ways these items are
                 created and modified, and their relationships between
                 one another. In this paper the authors address these
                 two issues. First, they will discuss three methods of
                 identifying objects the first two of which were
                 suggested by Liu and Wilde; the third method is one
                 that is proposed in this paper and is based on the
                 determination of the receiver of a procedure. We
                 believe that the latter method is one that is more
                 natural and precise than the former two. Second,
                 algorithms that perform precise interprocedural
                 flow-sensitive dependency analysis, as well as
                 algorithms that identify 'objects', are introduced.
                 Furthermore, the internal program representation that
                 we emply, the parse-tree-based system dependence graph
                 (SDG), is briefly discussed. Finally, a unique tool
                 that we have developed is presented that accepts a
                 subset of ANSI C (or Pascal) as input and which
                 implements all algorithms discussed in this paper."

                 finite schema, and a space-time tradeoff principle are
                 obtained. It is shown that maximal parallelism is a
                 decidable property for finite schemata, but that there
                 are finite schemata whose maximally parallel form
                 requires an infinite control and an infinite number of

                 does not live up to users expectations yet, and
                 dependence analysis algorithms which either produce too
                 many false dependences or are too slow to contribute
                 significantly to this. In this paper we introduce
                 dataflow dependence analysis algorithm which exactly
                 computes value-based dependence relations for program
                 fragments in which all subscripts, loop bound and IF
                 conditions are affine. Our algorithm also computes good
                 affine approximations of dependence relations for
                 non-affine program fragments. Actually, we do not know
                 about any other algorithm which can compute better
                 approximations. And our algorithm is efficient too,
                 because it is lazy. When searching for write statements
                 that supply values used by a given read statement, it
                 starts with statements which are lexicographically
                 close to the read statement in iteration space. Then if
                 some of the read statement instances are not
                 ``satisfied'' with these close writes, the algorithm
                 broadens its search scope by looking into more distant
                 writes. The search scope keeps broadening until all
                 read instances are satisfied or no write candidates are
                 left. We timed our algorithm on several benchmark
                 programs and the timing results suggest that our
                 algorithm is fast enough to be used in commercial
                 compilers---it usually takes 5 to 15 percent of f77 -02
                 compilation time to analyze a program. Most programs in
                 the 100-line range take less than 1 second to analyze
                 on a SUN SPARCstation IPX.",

    reduced to one of minimizing a function. In our work, the function is minimized by using one of two genetic
    algorithms in place of the local minimization techniques used in earlier research. We describe the implementation
    of our GA-based system and examine the effectiveness of this approach on a number of programs, one of
    which is significantly larger than those for which results have previously been reported in the literature. We
    also examine the effect of program complexity on the test data generation problem by executing our system
    on a number of synthetic programs that have varying complexities."

                 assets in software libraries gives rise to a number of
                 paradoxes: While this subject has been under
                 investigation for nearly two decades, it still remains
                 an active area of research in software reuse and
                 software engineering; this can be explained by the
                 observation that new technologies (such as the
                 internet, the world wide web, object-oriented
                 programming) keep opening new opportunities for better
                 asset packaging, better library organizations, and
                 larger scale libraries---thereby posing new technical
                 challenges. Also, while many sophisticated solutions
                 have been proposed to this problem, the state of the
                 practice in software reuse is characterized by the use
                 of ad-hoc, low-tech methods; this can be explained by
                 the observation that most existing solutions are either
                 too ineffective to be useful or too intractable to be
                 usable. Finally, while it is difficult to imagine a
                 successful software reuse program without a
                 sophisticated, well-tuned, systematic procedure for
                 software component storage and retrieval, it seems many
                 successful software reuse experiments rely on trivial
                 methods of component storage and retrieval; this can be
                 explained by the observation that, in the current state
                 of the practice, software libraries are not the
                 bottleneck of the software reuse process. This paper
                 presents a survey of methods of storage and retrieval
                 of software assets in software libraries. In addition
                 to a review of existing research efforts, the paper
                 makes two contributions. First, a definition of
                 (presumably) orthogonal attributes of storage and
                 retrieval methods; these attributes are used, in turn,
                 to classify existing methods into six broad classes.
                 Second, a definition of (presumably) orthogonal
                 assessment criteria, which include technical,
                 managerial and human factors; these criteria afford us
                 an exhaustive and uniform basis for assessing and
                 comparing individual methods and classes of methods.",

                 engineering as adaptive algorithms for solving
                 practical problems and as computational models of
                 natural evolutionary systems. This brief, accessible
                 introduction describes some of the most interesting
                 research in the field and also enables readers to
                 implement and experiment with genetic algorithms on
                 their own. It focuses in depth on a small set of
                 important and interesting topics -- particularly in
                 machine learning, scientific modeling, and artificial
                 life -- and reviews a broad span of research, including
                 the work of Mitchell and her colleagues. The
                 descriptions of applications and modeling projects
                 stretch beyond the strict boundaries of computer
                 science to include dynamical systems theory, game
                 theory, molecular biology, ecology, evolutionary
                 biology, and population genetics, underscoring the
                 exciting {"}general purpose{"} nature of genetic
                 algorithms as search methods that can be employed
                 across disciplines. An Introduction to Genetic
                 Algorithms is accessible to students and researchers in
                 any scientific discipline. It includes many thought and
                 computer exercises that build on and reinforce the
                 reader's understanding of the text. The first chapter
                 introduces genetic algorithms and their terminology and
                 describes two provocative applications in detail. The
                 second and third chapters look at the use of genetic
                 algorithms in machine learning (computer programs, data
                 analysis and prediction, neural networks) and in
                 scientific models (interactions among learning,
                 evolution, and culture; sexual selection; ecosystems;
                 evolutionary activity). Several approaches to the
                 theory of genetic algorithms are discussed in depth in
                 the fourth chapter. The fifth chapter takes up
                 implementation, and the last chapter poses some
                 currently unanswered questions and surveys prospects
                 for the future of evolutionary computation.",

                 programming-in-the-large. Rigi uses a graph model and
                 abstraction mechanisms to structure and represent the
                 information accumulated during the development process.
                 The objects and relationships of the graph model
                 represent system components and their dependencies. The
                 objects can be arranged in aggregation and
                 generalization hierarchies. The Rigi editor assists the
                 designers, programmers, integrators, and maintainers in
                 defining, manipulating, exploring, and understanding,
                 the structure of large, integrated, evolving software
                 systems. Rigi was designed to address three of the most
                 difficult problems in the area of
                 programming-in-the-large: the mastery of the structural
                 complexity of large software systems, the effective
                 presentation of development information, and the
                 definition of procedures for checking and maintaining
                 the completeness, consistency, and traceability of
                 system descriptions. Thus, the major objective of Rigi
                 is to effectively represent and manipulate the building
                 blocks of a software system and their myriad
                 dependencies, thereby aiding the development phases of

Argues very informally for the software testing using assertions approach.
The second author (in 1994) had worked on Mess Word for 3 years as the
leader of the test team.
The paper claims that assertion based programming has been adopted
by M$ as a whole. The paper is technically uninteresting, but is significant
becuase of the claim that M$ make extensive of use assertion based programming.

                 of aiding in and improving the programming process.
                 Despite their potential, they have not been successful,
                 as evidenced by limited use. In general, they are
                 perceived as being too difficult to use and the
                 benefits of their use are outweighed by the
                 difficulties. We believe that the cognitive styles and
                 skills of the users have been ignored in the design
                 process. In this paper we present some of our initial
                 results which show that cognitive styles vary over a
                 significant spectrum and that their consideration in
                 the design of a syntax-directed editor will result in
                 an intelligent tool that will be right for the
                 cognitive skills and expertise of an individual user.
                 In turn, an approach to design that takes cognitive
                 variation into account would support the construction
                 of syntax-directed editors which are successfully

                 and are purely declarative, i.e. they support the
                 notaion of referential transparency and are devoid of
                 side effects. Traditional debugging techniques are,
                 however, not suited for lazy functiona languages since
                 computations generally do not take place in the order
                 one might expect. Since {\em algorithmic debugging}
                 allows the user to concerntrate on the declarative
                 aspects of program semantics, and will
                 semi-automatically find functions containing bugs, we
                 propose to use this tecnique for debugging lazy
                 functional programs. Our earlier work showed that this
                 is a promising approach. However, the current version
                 of our debugger has severe implementational problems,
                 e.g. too large trace size and too many questions asked.
                 This paper suggests a number of techniques for
                 overcoming these problems, at least partially. The key
                 techniques are {\em immediate strictification} and {\em
                 piecemeal tracing}.",

  abstract =	"Cultural Algorithms are self-adaptive models that
		 support the collective evolution process through the
		 employment of a population and a belief space. Here,
		 the Cultural approach is applied to derive a
		 generalized set of beliefs from successive populations
		 of parameter configurations from an agent-based
		 simulation of transactions within a durable goods
		 market. The maintenance of this information allows for
		 the guided evolution of the agent-based system over
		 successive simulations. In order to more effectively
		 evaluate parameter configurations, Software Engineering
		 techniques of white and black box testing are applied.
		 In this paper, a methodology for the use of Cultural
		 Algorithms to optimize strategies in agent-based models
		 is presented. This approach is demonstrated in an
		 application used to model pricing strategies in the
		 context of an agent-based model under a simulated
		 real-world market scenario and a heterogeneous
		 population."

abstract =     "In November 1986, the Software Engineering Institute
                 with assistance from the Mitre began developing a
                 process maturity framework that would assist
                 organizations in improving their software process. This
                 effort was initiated in response to a request to
                 provide the federal government with a method for
                 assessing the capability of their software contractors.
                 in September 1987, the SEI released a brief description
                 of the process maturity framework and a maturity
                 questionnaire (CMU/SEI-87-TR-23). The SEI intended the
                 maturity questionnaire to provide a simple tool for
                 identifying areas where an organization's software
                 process needed improvement. Unfortunately, the
                 questionnaire was too often regarded as {"}the model{"}
                 rather than as a vehicle for exploring process maturity
                 issues. After four years of experience with the
                 software process maturity framework and the preliminary
                 version of the maturity questionnaire, the SEI has
                 evolved the software process maturity framework into a
                 fully defined model. This model will be used in a
                 systematic, principled way to derive a maturity
                 questionnaire. By fully elaborating the maturity
                 framework, a model has emerged that provides
                 organizations with more effective guidance for
                 establishing process improvement programs that were
                 offered by the maturity questionnaire. Using knowledge
                 acquired from software process assessments and
                 extensive feedback from both industry and government,
                 an improved version of the process maturity framework
                 and been produced called the Capability Maturity Model
                 for Software (CMM). This paper is an introduction too
                 the revised model."}

                 techniques. Two generalizations of control and data
                 flow dependence, called weak and strong syntactic
                 dependence, are introduced and related to a concept
                 called semantic dependence. Semantic dependence models
                 the ability of a program statement to affect the
                 execution behavior of other statements. It is shown
                 that weak syntactic dependence is a necessary but not
                 sufficient condition for semantic dependence and that
                 strong syntactic dependence is necessary but not
                 sufficient condition for a restricted form of semantic
                 dependence that is finitely demonstrated. These results

                 introduced by Mark Weiser, is a fundamental operation
                 for addressing many software-engineering problems,
                 including program understanding, debugging,
                 maintenance, testing, and merging. A slice determines
                 either all program elements that might affect a given
                 element (``backward slicing'') or all elements that
                 could be affected by a given element (``forward
                 slicing''). Jackson and Rollins introduced a related
                 operation, called {\em program chopping}, which is a
                 kind of ``filtered'' slice: Chopping answers questions
                 of the form ``What are all the program elements $v$
                 that serve to transmit effects from a given source
                 element $s$ to a given target element $t$?'' However,
                 Jackson and Rollins define only a limited form of
                 chopping: Among other restrictions, they impose the
                 restriction that $s$ and $t$ be in the same procedure.
                 This paper solves the unrestricted interprocedural
                 chopping problem, as well as a variety of other useful
                 variants of interprocedural chopping."

                 that slicing performs is different from the
                 specialization operations performed by algorithms for
                 partial evaluation, supercompilation, bifurcation, and
                 deforestation. To study the relationship between
                 slicing and these operations in a simplified setting,
                 we consider the problem of slicing functional programs.
                 We identify two different goals for what we mean by
                 ``slicing a functional program'' and give algorithms
                 that correspond to each of them."

                 polynomial time by transforming them into a special
                 kind of graph-reachability problem. The only
                 restrictions are that the set of dataflow facts must be
                 a finite set, and that the dataflow functions must
                 distribute over the confluence operator (either union
                 or intersection). This class of probable problems
                 includes---but is not limited to---the classical
                 separable problems (also known as ``gen/kill'' or
                 ``bit-vector'' problems)---\emph{e.g.}, reaching
                 definitions, available expressions, and live variables.
                 In addition, the class of problems that our techniques
                 handle includes many non-separable problems, including
                 truly-live variables, copy constant propagation, and
                 possibly-uninitialized variables. Results are reported
                 from a preliminary experimental study of C programs

                 code. A heuristic design similarity measure is defined,
                 based on the Parnas' information hiding principle. The
                 measure supports two services: clustering, which
                 identifies groups of related procedures, and maverick
                 analysis, which identifies individual procedures that
                 appear to be in the wrong module. The tool has already
                 provided useful advice in several real programming
                 projects. The tool will soon incorporate an automatic
                 tuning method, which allows the tool to learn from its
                 mistakes, adapting its advice to the architect's
                 preferences. A preliminary experiment demonstrates that
                 the automatically tuned similarity function can assign
                 procedures to modules very accurately."

                 problem of infering configuration structures from
                 existing source code. Concept analysis has been
                 developed by German mathematicans over the last years;
                 it can be seen as a discrete analogon to Fourier
                 analysis. Based on this theory, the authors' tool will
                 accept source code, where configuration-specific
                 statements are controlled by the preprocessor. The
                 algorithm will compute a so-called concept lattice,
                 which - when visually displayed - allows remarkable
                 insight into the structure and properties of possible
                 configurations. The lattice not only displays
                 fine-grained dependencies between configuration
                 threads, but also visualizes the overall quality of
                 configuration structures according to software
                 engineering principles. The paper presents a short
                 introduction to concept analysis, as well as
                 experimental results on various programs."

                 concept lattice is constructed. The paper explains how
                 module structures show up in the lattice, and how the
                 lattice can be used to assess cohesion and coupling
                 between module candidates. Certain algebraic
                 decompositions of the lattice can lead to automatic
                 generation of modularization proposals. The method is
                 applied to several examples written in Modula-2,
                 Fortran, and Cobol; among them a >100 kloc aerodynamics

  abstract =    "Visualization can provide valuable assistance for data
                 analysis and decision making tasks. However, how people
                 perceive and interact with a visualization tool can
                 strongly influence their understanding of the data as
                 well as the system's usefulness. Human factors
                 therefore contribute significantly to the visualization
                 process and should play an important role in the design
                 and evaluation of visualization tools. Several research
                 initiatives have begun to explore human factors in
                 visualization, particularly in perception-based design.
                 Nonetheless, visualization work involving human factors
                 is in its infancy, and many potentially promising areas
                 have yet to be explored. Therefore, this paper aims to
                 1) review known methodology for doing human factors
                 research, with specific emphasis on visualization, 2)
                 review current human factors research in visualization
                 to provide a basis for future investigation, and 3)
                 identify promising areas for future research.",

  abstract =     "I propose to consider the question, 'Can machines
                 think?' This should begin with definitions of the
                 meaning of the terms 'machine' and 'think.' The
                 definitions might be framed so as to reflect so far as
                 possible the normal use of the words, but this attitude
                 is dangerous, If the meaning of the words 'machine' and
                 'think' are to be found by examining how they are
                 commonly used it is difficult to escape the conclusion
                 that the meaning and the answer to the question, 'Can
                 machines think?' is to be sought in a statistical
                 survey such as a Gallup poll. But this is absurd.
                 Instead of attempting such a definition I shall replace
                 the question by another, which is closely related to it
                 and is expressed in relatively unambiguous words. The
                 new form of the problem can be described in terms of a
                 game which we call the 'imitation game.' It is played
                 with three people, a man (A), a woman (B), and an
                 interrogator (C) who may be of either sex. The
                 interrogator stays in a room apart front the other two.
                 The object of the game for the interrogator is to
                 determine which of the other two is the man and which
                 is the woman. He knows them by labels X and Y, and at
                 the end of the game he says either 'X is A and Y is B'
                 or 'X is B and Y is A.' The interrogator is allowed to
                 put questions to A and B. We now ask the question,
                 'What will happen when a machine takes the part of A in
                 this game?' Will the interrogator decide wrongly as
                 often when the game is played like this as he does when
                 the game is played between a man and a woman? These
                 questions replace our original, 'Can machines think?'"

                 mutation analysis systems suffer from severe
                 performance problems. This paper presents a new method
                 for performing mutation analysis that uses
                 \emph{program schemata} to encode all mutants for a
                 program into one \emph{metaprogram}, which is
                 subsequently compiled and run at speeds substantially
                 higher than achieved by previous interpretive systems.
                 Preliminary performance improvements of over 300 are
                 reported. This method has the additional advantages of
                 being easier to implement than interpretive systems,
                 being simpler to port across a wide range of hardware
                 and software platforms, and using the same compiler and

                 technique that has been studied in the context of
                 several different applications in the construction,
                 optimization, maintenance, testing, and debugging of
                 programs. Algorithms are available for constructing
                 slices for a particular execution of a program (dynamic
                 slices), as well as to approximate a subset of the
                 behavior over all possible executions of a program
                 (static slices). However, these algorithms have been
                 studied only in the context of small abstract
                 languages. Program slicing is bound to remain an
                 academic exercise unless one can not only demonstrate
                 the feasibility of building a slicer for nontrivial
                 programs written in a real programming language, but
                 also verify that a type of slice is sufficiently thin,
                 on the average, for the application for which it is
                 chosen. In this article, we present results from using
                 {\em SLICE}, a dynamic program slicer for C programs,
                 designed and implemented to experiment with several
                 different kinds of program slices and to study them
                 both qualitatively and quantitatively. Several
                 application programs, ranging in size (i.e., number of
                 lines of code) over two orders of magnitude, were
                 sliced exhaustively to obtain average worst-case
                 metrics for the size of program slices.",

  abstract =	"The principle of separation of concerns has long been
		 used by software engineers to manage the complexity of
		 software system development. Programming languages help
		 software engineers explicitly maintain the separation
		 of some concerns in code. As another step towards
		 increasing the scope of concerns that can be captured
		 cleanly within the code, Kiczales and colleagues have
		 introduced aspect-oriented programming. In
		 aspect-oriented programming, explicit language support
		 is provided to help modularize design decisions that
		 cross-cut a functionally-decomposed program.
		 Aspect-oriented programming is intended to make it
		 easier to reason about, develop, and maintain certain
		 kinds of application code. To investigate these claims,
		 we conducted two exploratory experiments that
		 considered the impact of aspect-oriented programming,
		 as found in AspectJ version 0.1, on two common
		 programming activities: debugging and change. Our
		 experimental results provide insights into the
		 usefulness and usability of aspect-oriented
		 programming. Our results also raise questions about the
		 characteristics of the interface between aspects and
		 functionallydecomposed core code that are necessary to
		 accrue programming benefits. Most notably, the
		 separation provided by aspect-oriented programming
		 seems most helpful when the interface is narrow (i.e.,
		 the separation is more complete); partial separation
		 does not necessarily provide partial benefit.",

                 representation that represents control flow as data
                 flow and makes explicit all machine quantities, such as
                 stores and I/O channels. We are developing a compiler
                 that builds a VDG representing a program, analyzes and
                 transforms the VDG, then produces a control flow graph
                 (CFG) [ASU86] from the optimized VDG. This framework
                 simplifies transformations and improves upon several
                 published results. For example, it enables more
                 powerful code motion than [CLZ86, FOW87], eliminates as
                 many redundancies as [AWZ88, RWZ88] (except for
                 redundant loops), and provides important information to
                 the code scheduler [BR91]. We exhibit a fast, one-pass
                 method for elimination of partial redundancies that
                 never performs redundant code motion [KFS92, DS93] and
                 is simpler than the classical [MR79, Dha91] or SSA
                 [RWZ88] methods. These results accrue from eliminating
                 the CFG from the analysis/transformation phases and
                 using \emph{demand dependences} in preference to
                 control dependences."

		 creating a suite of tests from requirements that
		 adequately exercise the behavior of a software system
		 without regard to the internal structure of the
		 implementation. In current practice, the adequacy of
		 black box test suites is inferred by examining coverage
		 on an executable artifact, either source code or a
		 software model. \par In this paper, we define
		 structural coverage metrics directly on high-level
		 formal software requirements. These metrics provide
		 \textit{objective, implementation-independent} measures
		 of how well a black-box test suite exercises a set of
		 requirements. We focus on structural coverage criteria
		 on requirements formalized as LTL properties and
		 discuss how they can be adapted to measure finite test
		 cases. These criteria can also be used to automatically
		 generate a requirements-based test suite. Unlike model
		 or code-derived test cases, these tests are immediately
		 traceable to high-level requirements. To assess the
		 practicality of our approach, we apply it on a
		 realistic example from the avionics domain."

                 and \emph{B}, each created by modifying separate copies
                 of \emph{Base}, the goal of program integration is to
                 determine whether the modifications interfere, and if
                 they do not, to create an integrated program that
                 includes both sets of changes as well as the portions
                 of \emph{Base} preserved in both variants. Text-based
                 integration techniques, such as the one used by the
                 Unix \emph{diff3} utility, are obviously unsatisfactory
                 because one has no guarantees about how the execution
                 behavior of the integrated program relates to the
                 behaviors of \emph{Base}, \emph{A}, and \emph{B}. The
                 first program-integration algorithm to provide such
                 guarantees was developed by Horwitz et
                 al.~\cite{1989:toplas:horwitz}. However, a limitation
                 of that algorithm is that it incorporates no notion of
                 semantics-preserving transformations. This limitation
                 causes the algorithm to be overly conservative in its
                 definition of interference. For example, if one variant
                 changes the \emph{way} a computation is performed
                 (without changing the values computed) while the other
                 variant adds code that uses the result of the
                 computation, the algorithm would classify those changes
                 as interfering. This paper describes a new integration
                 algorithm that is able to accommodate
                 semantics-preserving transformations."
